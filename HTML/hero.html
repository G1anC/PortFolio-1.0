    <div class="qualifications">

        I started developping about 2 years ago and the more i advance, the more i get qualifications on multiple languages and applications:
        So these are the coding-language i'm confident on (from the most to the least) :
        C, bash, html, css, C++, JavaScript, Node.js, Haskell, ASM, php

        And these are the applications i can fluidly use :
        Git, Github, Visual Studio Code, PowerPoint, Emacs, npm, Canva
    </div>





    <div class="in-the-future">
        I truly have a lot to learn and i look forward to take every bit of experience i can get. My school is perfect for me and i will come out of EPITECH in 2027.
        And so i still have 3 years to train before getting to a 100% in the professional world, although i have stages in my years of school.
