            Introduction : 
            My name is Noah STEINIGER & i'm a student at EPITECH Strasbourg, in France and i'm striving to become a UI / UX developper.
            <br><br>
            Now that i have made a simple and boring synthesis of who i am, let's dig into my personnality shell we ?
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="where-from">
        <br>
        My full name is actually <span class="magic">Noah Giancarlo Steiniger Rubiero</span>. 
        I come from a hard-worker and pationate family. Seeing my parents, i find it logic that i came to appreciate UI/UX. 
        I inherited the creative and artistic side of my mother, Evelyne, from whom i've made a webiste so that you could clearly see
        what i talk about (go to my works section). and inherited my father's way of work, Franck is an excellent cook
        and i took from him the will to always find a better way to do my job and to have a perfectionnalist way of delivering
        quality work no matter what i do.
    </div>

    <div class="qualifications">
        <br><br>
        I started developping about 2 years ago and the more i advance, the more i get qualifications on multiple languages and applications:
        <br>
        So these are the coding-language i'm confident on (from the most to the least) :
        <br>
        C, JavaScript, Node.js, Three.js, html, css, C++, Haskell, ASM, php
        <br><br>
        And these are the applications i can fluidly use :
        <br>
        npm, Git, Github, PowerPoint, Visual Studio Code, Emacs, Canva
    </div>

    <div class="in-the-future">
        I truly have a lot to learn and i look forward to take every bit of experience i can get. My school is perfect for me and i will come out of EPITECH in 2027.
        And so i still have 3 years to train before getting to a 100% in the professional world, although i have stages in my years of school.
